Hey, I’ve gone through the initial requirements and I’m trying to understand the full picture before I finalize the database design. I do have a few beginner-level doubts that I’d love to clarify with you, just to make sure I’m not missing anything important .

1.About Companies & Warehouses
Just checking — can a warehouse be linked to more than one company, or does each warehouse strictly belong to one company only?
Do we need to store the full address for each warehouse? Like city, pincode, etc.? Or is just the warehouse name enough?
Do warehouses have any storage limit? Like, do we need to track how much quantity they can hold in total or per product?

2. About Products & Inventory
Do the products have any types or categories? Like, should we mention if it’s raw material or finished item?
Should we also track the price or cost of a product? And if yes, will the price vary depending on which warehouse it’s stored in?
Do any products have expiry dates? Should I add a column for that, or not needed?
If a product becomes out of stock in a warehouse, should we store that status anywhere or notify someone?

3.About Inventory Changes
Just to clarify — what are the usual reasons that inventory quantity changes? Like is it because of purchase, return, or damage?
Do we also need to store who made the inventory change? Like the employee or system that updated it?
We are tracking quantity changes, but should I also store the date and time of the change?

4.About Suppliers
Can one supplier supply products to multiple companies, or is it always linked to just one?
Also, do we need to keep contact details of suppliers like phone number, email, etc.?

5. About Bundled Products
If a product is a bundle, should I store the list of products inside that bundle in a separate table?
Also, can a bundle contain other bundles inside it? Or just individual items only?

These were some of the things I wasn’t totally sure about while trying to design the tables. Just wanted to double check before moving forward, so that we don’t miss anything important later
